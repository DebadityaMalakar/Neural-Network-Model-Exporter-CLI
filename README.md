## 🤔 What is This?

A single-file Python CLI that trains a neural network on MNIST and exports it to **CSV, JSON, or YAML** formats because why use efficient binary when you can have glorious human-readable bloat?

```bash
# Because if CSV can be a database, it can be a model too! 🙏💀
python main.py --format csv --epochs 10
```

## 🎯 Why Would Anyone Do This?

- **"Explainable AI"** taken to the extreme (open weights in Excel!)
- **Manager-friendly models** (impress non-technical stakeholders)
- **Academic curiosity** (how inefficient can we get?)
- **Job security** (nobody will want to maintain this)
- **Because we can** (the best reason of all)

## ✨ Features

- **Single-file implementation** - No complicated setup!
- **Multiple export formats** - CSV, JSON, YAML (choose your poison)
- **Progress bars** - Watch the inefficiency happen in real-time!
- **Visualizations** - See your model's predictions and weights
- **Inefficiency reports** - Quantify how wasteful you've been!
- **CLI interface** - Because clicking is too efficient

## 🚀 Quick Start

```bash
# 1. Clone or download this single file
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DebadityaMalakar/Neural-Network-Model-Exporter-CLI/main/main.py

# 2. Install requirements (if you want to be fancy)
pip install torch torchvision pandas numpy matplotlib pyyaml tqdm

# 3. Run with default settings (CSV format, 10 epochs)
python main.py

# 4. Marvel at your inefficient masterpiece!
```

## 💻 Usage Examples

```bash
# Export to CSV (spreadsheet hell)
python main.py --format csv --epochs 10 --output my_csv_model

# Export to JSON (brace madness)
python main.py --format json --epochs 5 --output json_model

# Export to YAML (indentation heaven/hell)
python main.py --format yaml --epochs 15 --output yaml_model

# Export to ALL formats (maximum chaos)
python main.py --format all --epochs 10 --output all_formats

# Skip visualizations (for when you're in a hurry to be inefficient)
python main.py --no-viz --format csv
```

## 📊 What You Get

After running the tool, you'll get:

- **Exported model files** in your chosen format(s)
- **Visualizations** of predictions and weights
- **Inefficiency report** showing how wasteful you've been
- **Metadata file** with training details
- **A sense of accomplishment** (questionable)

## 🏆 Format Showdown

| Format | Pros | Cons | Best For |
|--------|------|------|----------|
| **CSV** | Excel-compatible, "explainable" | Massive file size, repetitive | Spreadsheet enthusiasts |
| **JSON** | Structured, widely supported | Brace overload, still large | Web developers |
| **YAML** | Human-readable, clean syntax | Indentation-sensitive | YAML masochists |

## 🤣 Real-World Applications

1. **Impress managers** - "Look, I can edit our AI in Excel!"
2. **Win hackathons** - "Most Creative Storage Solution"
3. **Teach students** - "This is why we use binary formats"
4. **Art installation** - Print the weights as wallpaper

## 🧠 How It Works

1. **Trains a CNN** on MNIST dataset
2. **Exports weights** to your chosen format(s)
3. **Generates visualizations** of predictions and filters
4. **Creates reports** on the glorious inefficiency
5. **Laughs at binary formats** (too efficient, too boring)

## 📁 Output Structure

```
exported_model/
├── *.csv/json/yaml          # Your glorious model weights
├── predictions.png          # Visualization of test predictions
├── weights_visualization.png # What the model learned
├── INEFFICIENCY_REPORT.txt  # How wasteful you've been
└── metadata.json           # Training details and metrics
```

## ⚙️ Advanced Options

```bash
# Train for more epochs (more accuracy, same inefficiency)
python main.py --epochs 20

# Custom output directory
python main.py --output my_glorious_model

# Skip visualizations (when you just want the data)
python main.py --no-viz

# See all options
python main.py --help
```

## 📊 Example Output

```
✅ Final Test Accuracy: 98.65%
✅ Export completed in 12.45 seconds
🎉 Mission accomplished! Your gloriously inefficient CSV model is ready!
📁 Files saved to: exported_model/
📊 Inefficiency achieved: 11.7x larger than binary!
🏆 You've successfully made AI storage 11.7x less efficient!
```

## 🎨 Sample Visualizations

The tool creates these beautiful (questionable) visualizations:

1. **predictions.png** - How well your model performs on test data
2. **weights_visualization.png** - What the convolutional filters learned

## 🤝 Contributing

Want to make this worse? Ideas welcome:

- [ ] Add XML export (because we haven't suffered enough)
- [ ] Implement SQLite storage (each weight as a row)
- [ ] Add PowerPoint export (one slide per weight)
- [ ] Create a physical print mode (for bookshelf deployment)



## 🎉 Acknowledgments

- **Excel** for not crashing immediately with 400,000+ rows
- **PyTorch** for making this too easy
- **MNIST** for being the "hello world" of ML
- **You** for reading this far instead of doing something productive

**Disclaimer**: Please don't use this in production. Seriously. I'm not responsible for your fired DevOps team or storage bills.

**Note**: This tool is intentionally inefficient. That's the whole point. If you want efficient model storage, use `.pt` or `.pth` files like a normal person.
